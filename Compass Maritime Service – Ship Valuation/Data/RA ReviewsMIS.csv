Gender,Location,Date,ReviewFemale,Philadelphia PA,7/29/16,"Absolutely HORRIBLE!! SHADYYYYY as all hell, unprofessional, crooked company. One of their tow trucks damaged my vehicle in several places. My Mercedes left in mint condition, it was returned to me with several thousand dollars in damage. Used hooks and chains to put my car on a flatbed because my car had no tow hook. Needless to say I was missing half my back bumper. The remaining half was cracked, scraped and had a hole in it. There was a gaping hole in my front grill that was not there before. Also dents on the lower passenger side. Not only did this company not believe me, not care, and stop responding to me all together. They FORGED MY NAME ON A DOCUMENT!!! they drew up a FAKE tow bill writing in all of these damages, and signed my name. it also had no date. Absolute scam artists. Avoid them at all cost. They destroyed my car and paid no price."Male,Porterville CA ,7/26/16,worst tow co. ever and im a statefarm agent...Female,Norwalk CT,2/25/16,"Two days ago my car overheated and I contact my insurance company (State Farm), I was transferred to RA Inc,, the third party roadside assistance provider they contract. I spoke to the first representative who took a payment and said she would try to locate a tow truck company and would update me via text, which I never received. I called back after an hour to inquire about the two and I was told by another representative that the company they contacted did not decline or accept the tow. I asked, ""How come that message was not relayed to me?"" and rep2 said, ""Well when we sent your info to the company, we don't know if they accept or decline. We just move on to the next caller."" Which I felt was very rude because it shows that I am not valued as a customer. I was upset and sought help elsewhere. I then got a text message 30 minutes later saying that my two truck would arrive in an hour. I called and cancelled and asked for a refund as I do not believe 3 hours is appropriate to wait for a tow. Long story short, I reported both reps and was contacted by management who did their best to remedy the situation. 

As for my insurance company State Farm, unprofessionalism was certainly exhibited on their part as I called many times to complain and asked to be contacted by my agent who never contacted me. When I contacted my insurance agent today, his attitude was very cavalier and he asked me what I expected him to do or say. I switched agents after 4 years and I was very clear that if I have one more negative experience with them, I will be going over to another insurance company. Major disappointment I would say. I would not recommend either companies after the experience I had."Male,San Antonio TX,2/16/16,If I could give 0 stars I would. I am currently waiting on a response in regards to a claim I made due to jumper cables being put on the battery wrong causing the ECM (car computer) frying by one of the towers. I spoke to Sandra (sadly I cant switch reps handling my claim) and she is by far the the rudest person I have ever spoke to. She called me to ask general questions in regards to the claim only to catch an attitude and cut me off every other sentence. If the last decision to approve or decline my claim is left up to her I am sure it will be denied. I would rather pay out of pocket for services in the future then to have to deal with this company ever again!Female,Virginia Beach VA,2/5/16,"Absolute WORST towing company ever. If I could rate it 0 stars, I would. I am apart of my mother's policy and needed road side services. We called state farm and they patched us to an RA Inc, dispatcher who then proceed to tell us our policy had expired in January however State Farm was showing our policy as active. The RA Inc, agent continued on how their systems weren't updated and that in order to receive the service we had to pay out of pocket and be reimbursed for the towing. That to me was incredibly absurd. To have to pay because their systems didn't update our policy period? We were lucky that or vehicle broke down close to home other wise we would have been pushing that car all the way home. State Farm did all they could but RA Inc, was completely awful. You're better off with spending the $100 a year on AAA than to add this towing company to your State Farm policies."Male,Atlanta GA,12/31/15,"Absolutely terrible. The only good thing about the experience is that there have been no wait times to talk to a rep, but the reps are totally useless. Mine told me I needed to schedule an appointment with Mazda prior to scheduling my towing to make sure they were ready when the car arrived. Mazda wanted my car in at 8am, otherwise they would not be able to take my car for two more days, so I scheduled the dispatch for 6am. It is 10:42am and the tow is just now arriving because they said they were not notified until 8:30 and then they were given no information from RA Inc, on my car situation, so they had to turn around and get a different truck. Thanks RA Inc, you guys should come drive me around for the next three days."Male,Seattle WA ,12/25/15,"A horrible towing company in Seattle (Allroad Towing) was dispatched by RA Inc.  The first time, not only did they not show for 3 hours, stranding me and my wife and daughter, the towing company was unreachable and the representative at RA Inc., was absolutely useless. I was able to find a tow truck on my own in under 30 minutes.

If you want to complain to the auto club/insurance company roadside service that's at the hub of this terrible service, the name of that company is RA Inc.  They're based on Medford, MA.  They are the main call center for all of the insurance company roadside assistance services.  They're the ones ultimately responsible for providing consumers with this horrible service.  

UPDATE (12/29/15): Heard from RA Inc, directly regarding my concerns and the poor service of the towing company they dispatched.  They took my concerns seriously and addressed them in full and showed a genuine willingness to take direct customer feedback and act on it.  My advice would be that if you get poor roadside service that's contracted through RA Inc, that you notify them directly.  They have over 30,000 tow providers.  I'm sure they can't perform quality assurance checks on all of them, so they need feedback from customers to make sure that the bad ones are weeded out."Male,Prospect CT ,12/22/15,"Still waiting. After two tows, I have never received an emailed receipt. I have been on the phone two days now and still no towing receipt. I don't trust this company has the capacity to legitimately honor the promise of providing a receipt. I have not seen one yet. So, my advice is this... Get the receipt from the tow truck driver when they pick up your vehicle."Male,Aurora CO,12/3/15,Yesterday I was locked out of my vehicle and my insurance company State Farm dispatched emergency roadside service through this company I made my phone call at 2 o'clock Colorado time through State Farm it wasn't until 345 that I was given a text stating that my emergency roadside person would be dispatched at 4:30 PM! 2 1/2 hours to wait is not industry-standard! I used to work in the industry as both a dispatcher and a roadside technician and even in a blizzard in Denver Colorado it should not take 2 1/2 hours to have a emergency roadside technician dispatched for an unlock. I have filed a complaint with State Farm I have left several messages on RA voicemail!!!!!! I don't think anybody works there I'm beginning to believe that RA is a shell companyMale,Los Angeles CA ,10/1/15,"I am insured by USAA. Following an accident I called USAA and they transferred me to RA Inc. A tow truck was dispatched and the driver informed me that he would be taking my car to the lot belonging to the tow truck company for storage. I told the driver I had already arranged for the car to be received by a Lexus recommended body shop. RA Inc,'s tow truck driver refused to follow my wishes and caused a two hour delay and several phone calls to RA Inc, and the tow truck driver's supervisor before the driver was willing to transport the car to my requested destination. It is not legal in California for an insurance company to dictate the body show used by their insured. The driver at one point threatened to drop the car off his truck and leave it at the accident scene. When we finally arrived at my body shop the shop was closed and I had to make alternative arrangements to leave the keys and log in the car."Male,Hattiesburg MS ,9/26/15,"RA Inc, is the absolute worst company with respect to customer service. Most times you try and speak with someone you go through the usual 15 prompts, (of course because our options have changed). When you finally reach a human, typically around 12 - 15 mins into the call, you are fed nothing but lies and awful service. I have been waiting for reimbursement for 2 towing chargess I paid out of pocket. Initially I was told the check would be sent the next day only to receive a letter 1 week later advising me my claim was approved and the check would follow within 7-10 business days. I called them again 2 weeks later and was told the check was mailed on 9-16-2015 which is 3 weeks past the first time they gave me the old ""check is in the mail"" lie. I was also advised that it would be 10-15 business days until it would arrive at my residence. Where in God's name does mail come from that takes 15 business days to any address within the USA?????? 
Long story short, today is 9-26-2015 and nothing as of today's mail. Good luck to anyone else who has to deal with this company."Female,Flower Mound TX ,9/19/15,"They hired a tow company called Tow n Go to tow my vehicle. The tow company put the boom thru my bumper and damaged my vehicle. ÊFor two weeks I tried to get Ê RA Inc, to fix my car because they said they would. Ê The rental car I would have to pay for and get reimbursed for it. ÊI told the lady I need my vehicle for my job and can't afford to rent a car for 4 weeks then wait for a reimbursement check. ÊI tried to explain the problem to the supervisor four times. ÊThey acted like they didn't care. ÊVery very disappointed in them and have told my insurance company that they should look into contacting Êwith a new roadside assistance company."Male,Philadelphia PA ,8/20/15,"Terrible service. Filling legal action against them for being so late, lost my job because of it. Absolutely the worst and inaccurate service and nobody even cares over there. They tell you 45 minute ETA. Completely forget about you, call you in a hour saying they are dispatching ANOTHER towing company because the first guys couldn't come and it took them an hour to realize that just to say no, they don't follow up on anything or anyone they work with."Male,Denver CO ,7/10/15,"If there was a  star thats what I would give them. the rep that i first worked with put in the wrong address for the tow truck to come get me help. When I called the tow truck Guy he would not come and pick me up cause he won't get paid so I'm stranded for 4hrs cause RA Inc, don't put customers first."Male,Seattle WA ,5/7/15,"Worst tow service I have ever experienced. They arrived 3 hours late to a scheduled appointment and they damaged my bumper when dropping it off at the body shop. The auto body shop in Bellevue saw RA Inc, Towing damage the bumper which ended up costing an additional $2.8k. I am still dealing with this and RA Inc, is not making the process easy. I recommend using another towing company and not taking the risk with RA Inc."Male,Norwalk CT ,3/4/15,"One star is one star too much. I paid for their service through Subaru Roadside Assistance and I might as well have paid for nothing. Eleven hours ago, my car became stuck in a pack of snow, slush, and ice. I immediately called for roadside assistance and they were unable to help me, stating that there were no available tow trucks and would dispatch one first thing in the morning and notify me shortly thereafter. I kindly obliged since I had some time to spare. I called first thing this morning and was told that they were unaware of the request and would dispatch a tow truck immediately and call me to confirm. Ninety minutes later, I still hadn't heard from them and decided to investigate. I called back and finally spoke with someone who advised me that a truck hadn't been dispatched. She went ahead and dispatched a truck with a 75 minute arrival time. After 75 minutes of waiting, I receive a text with an updated arrival time of three hours with a different towing company. I call back inquiring, the representative advised me that the initial towing company had cancelled the tow ten minutes prior to arrival for unknown reasons. Bottom line, it shouldn't take 15 hours to get a tow, Subaru Roadside Assistance -  RA was a was a waste of time and money, and my car is still stuck... Best of all, they'll kindly reimburse you if you decide to pay out of pocket for a towing company, with better response times, that they don't have a payment agreement with. Classy!"Male,Boston MA ,12/4/14,"My entire experience, start to finish, was flawless!
One morning this past spring my car was acting up. It would start but then after about a minute of running it would shut off if it wasn't moving. So, I found my RA Inc, card and called in for service. I didn't have to wait more than a minute to reach a live agent on the phone and she was prompt with taking my information. Within a couple of minutes after the call I received a text with the ETA of the tow truck driver, the name of the company and their phone number. They quoted me a 45 min. ETA which I thought was great considering it was morning rush hour traffic. The tow truck called me when they were 10 mins out, and arrived right on time! I was impressed!

The tow truck driver was very careful when hooking my car and was very pleasant to interact with. He even let me ride in the truck with him to the shop.

I ended up buying a new car so I probably won't be calling in anytime soon (hopefully), but I highly recommend RA Inc,'s roadside assistance services and will definitely use them again in the future!"Male,Framingham MA,9/5/14,"My insurance company Liberty Mutual contracts with RA Inc, for roadside assistance. We contacted them when our vehicle broke down on the highway. We placed a call for assistance at 1:09 pm and received a call back at 1:53pm that they were having a problem finding a tow truck. At 2:24pm we received a 2nd call that the tow truck was on its way. Per the roadside agreement when the vehicle is towed to an approved repair shop there is no charge for towing. Once we finally get the vehicle towed the tow truck driver informs me that there is an additional charge of $179 for the tow. (total distance 8 miles) I contacted Liberty Mutual and confirmed the roadside agreement and was instructed to contact RA Inc, who then instructed me to file a claim with Liberty. Now RA Inc, is saying we cancelled the tow as they never filed a claim. By the time the tow truck picked up our vehicle the repair shop was closed and all the local car rental agents were closed. The bigger issue was the fact that we were almost hit several times by passing vehicles on the highway and the post traumatic stress my wife and family have from the incident. Do yourself a favor and breakdown and get AAA."Female,Moraga CA ,7/30/14,"I wish I can give this company a 0. We are in California. My mom and I have been waiting in the car for 3 hours and every time we call them they say they need 30 min to come, and they refuse to tell you where the driver is. We're tired and hungry. I'm convinced the workers are taught to tell customers that the driver will be there in half an hour every time they call. Take it from me and NEVER use these guys to help you with roadside assistance, you'll be literally waiting the entire day for your car to get towed!"Male,San Diego CA ,7/3/14,"You better hope you don't need roadside assistance (and have RA Inc,)."Male,Brooklyn NY ,6/26/14,"I filed a complaint for damages on my motorcycle after a towing was done by one of their service provider. Their liability department is supposed to take 4 business days to decide wether the damages were cause by the service provider and it's been almost three weeks now. RA Inc, employees give their names and their extension numbers to reach them but somehow they seem to be always ""out of the office"". I managed to speak with the person in charge of my case at the beginning of this week. He said I'd get an answer by Wednesday or Thursday at the latest. It didn't happen so I sent him an email and called him. He was out of the office. I spoke to someone of another department who said the case is now handled by someone else. It's the third time that it's happening.....so now I really don't have much faith.Ê"Female,Phoenix AZ ,11/10/13,"NO STAR-ZERO STAR GIVEN. i agree. reps are rude for the most part. esp the STATE FARM dept which they are catering to.. they seem to think customers sitting at home in the lazy-boy are more important then people stuck on a freeway. and always being hung up on by reps is really getting old. any one who deals with RA Inc, can ask for the reps ext they use to log into their phones with and report them when they are rude or hang up .... Êexts starts with a 3-MA, 2-TN.,8-CANADA, 5-FL., AND 4-AZ officies.."Male,Livermore CA ,10/29/13,"They are hard to get a hold of ÊWhen you finally get to a ""claim rep"" he acts like everyone is out to get his company ÊSounds paranoid maybe because they suk at their job. ÊThey did not take seriously their job as an arbitrator. ÊEither that, or they have a secret agenda that does not bode well for the unsuspecting general public that may have to rely on RA Inc. ÊAll I can say is, ""good luck to you if you must deal with them"". ÊThey either knowingly lie or they are incompetent. They can still make it right with me, but it's been a month and I'm losing faith in their integrity."
